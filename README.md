# CompPyTools
Small Python scripts developed in the CompOmics group. The scripts are tentatively organized by topics they're more relevant to, and their descriptions can be found in the [wiki pages](https://github.com/compomics/CompPyTools/wiki). Contributions are welcome; however if you do contribute, please try to update the wiki page so that we can be as up-to-date as possible.
